# Snake üêçüçé

# Description
The Snake game is an online game where the player guides a growing snake to eat the apple while avoiding obstacles and its own tail.
Use the arrow keys to move the "snake" around the board, with no way to stop. Once the snake eats the food it grows larger. 
Originally, the game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. **In this version**, the game only ends when the snakes moves into itself.
The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.
